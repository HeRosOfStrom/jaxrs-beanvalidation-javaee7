# Validating JAX-RS resource data with Bean Validation in Java EE 7

This project goal is to demonstrate that, despite the used technologies being part of the Java EE 7 specification, proprietary dependencies are required to properly internationalize the error messages produced by Bean Validation.

* The Glassfish code was first used on an article written for [JAX Magazine](http://jaxenter.com/jax-magazine/JAX-Magazine-2013-06) and later posted on [JAXenter](http://jaxenter.com/integrating-bean-validation-with-jax-rs-48461.html).
* The WildFly code was used for a post on my own blog at [Validating JAX-RS resource data with Bean Validation in WildFly 8]().
